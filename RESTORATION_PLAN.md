# Restoration Plan for Deleted Files

## Issue Summary
PR #49 accidentally removed 100+ files with extremely long paths while adding the sacred-quant modules. The file paths are so long that standard git operations fail with "File name too long" errors, preventing us from using normal git commands to restore the files.

## Files to Restore
Files from directories including:
- DNA_HEART/ (DNA_HEART.cs, DNA_HEART Module)
- Deco_10/QMP_Overrider_Final_Unified/ (ADVANCED_MODULES_INTEGRATION.md, DEVIN_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md, DEVIN_README.md)
- ultra_modules/ (dna_heart.py and others)
- verification/ (core verification modules)
- And many others (100+ files total)

## Sacred-Quant Modules Already Preserved
The following sacred-quant modules were successfully added in PR #49 and are preserved in the current repository:
- QOL-AI V2 Encryption Engine (core/qol_engine.py)
- Legba Crossroads Algorithm (signals/legba_crossroads.py)
- Vèvè Market Triggers (signals/veve_triggers.py)
- Liquidity Mirror Scanner (quant/liquidity_mirror.py)
- Time Fractal Predictor (quant/time_fractal.py)
- Entropy Shield (quant/entropy_shield.py)
- Quant Core Integration (quant/quant_core.py)
- Documentation (SACRED_QUANT_MODULES.md)

## Restoration Process Using GitHub's Web Interface
Due to file path length issues, the restoration needs to be done through GitHub's web interface:

1. Go to the commit before PR #49 (commit 1479624)
2. Browse the repository at that state
3. For each deleted file:
   a. Navigate to the file in the repository
   b. Click on the file to view its contents
   c. Click the "..." button in the top-right corner
   d. Select "Edit this file"
   e. Make no changes, just click "Commit changes"
   f. In the commit message, enter "Restore [filename]"
   g. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
   h. Name the branch "restore-[filename]"
   i. Click "Propose changes"
   j. Create the pull request

4. Alternatively, for bulk restoration:
   a. Download the repository at commit 1479624 as a ZIP file
   b. Extract the files locally
   c. Create a new branch from the current main
   d. Copy the extracted files to the new branch
   e. Commit and push the changes
   f. Create a pull request

## Technical Limitations
Standard git operations fail with "File name too long" errors when trying to checkout the commit before PR #49, making it impossible to use normal git commands to restore the files.

## Next Steps
1. Review this restoration plan
2. Begin restoring files using the GitHub web interface
3. Merge the restored files back into the main branch
