## Integration with QMP Overrider

The QMP Overrider system integrates with QuantConnect through this directory. The integration allows the advanced components of the QMP Overrider system (Dimensional Transcendence Layer, Quantum Consciousness Network, Temporal Singularity Engine, Reality Anchor Points, Market Maker Slayer, etc.) to be deployed on QuantConnect for live trading.

## Deployment Workflow

1. Train ML models using Google Colab
2. Push trained models to GitHub
3. QuantConnect pulls latest models from GitHub
4. Deploy to live trading on QuantConnect

## Performance Tracking

The integration includes performance tracking components that log model performance, trade results, and other metrics for analysis and improvement.

## Additional Features

- Model Performance Logger: Track model drift over time
- Risk Framework: Adaptive exposure control
- Sentiment Fusion: Integrate Twitter or GDELT sentiment
- Latent Alpha Miner: Search alternative data for edge
- QuantConnect Webhook Input: Accept live data or triggers from web
