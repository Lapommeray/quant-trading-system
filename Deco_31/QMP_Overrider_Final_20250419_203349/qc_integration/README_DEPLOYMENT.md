# QMP Overrider QuantConnect Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the QMP Overrider system on QuantConnect for live trading.

## Prerequisites

1. QuantConnect account with API access
2. GitHub repository with the QMP Overrider code
3. Interactive Brokers or Alpaca account (for live trading)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Create a GitHub repository with the following structure:
```
/QMP_Overrider_QuantConnect/
├── /qc_integration/
│   ├── /qc_strategies/          # QuantConnect-compatible algorithms
│   │   ├── dark_pool_sniper.py  
│   │   ├── order_flow_hunter.py
│   │   ├── stop_hunter.py
│   │   └── mm_slayer.py
│   ├── /ml_models/              # Colab-trained models
│   │   ├── liquidity_predictor.pkl
│   │   └── hft_behavior.h5
│   ├── /data_connectors/        # Broker APIs
│   │   ├── alpaca_adapter.py
│   │   └── ibkr_adapter.py
│   └── /tradingview/            # TradingView integration
│       └── qc_signal_mirror.pine
```

2. Push the QMP Overrider code to the repository.

### 2. Link GitHub Repository to QuantConnect

1. Log in to QuantConnect.
2. Go to "My Projects" and click "New Project".
3. Select "Import from GitHub".
4. Enter your GitHub repository URL.
5. Select the branch to import.
6. Click "Import".

### 3. Configure QuantConnect Algorithm

1. Open the imported project in QuantConnect.
2. Navigate to the `qc_strategies/mm_slayer.py` file.
3. Update the GitHub repository URL in the `LoadModel` method to point to your repository.
4. Configure the algorithm parameters (symbols, timeframes, etc.).
5. Save the algorithm.

### 4. Backtest the Algorithm

1. Click "Backtest" to run a backtest of the algorithm.
2. Review the backtest results.
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the algorithm.

### 5. Deploy to Paper Trading

1. Click "Live Trading" to deploy the algorithm to paper trading.
2. Select "Paper Trading" as the brokerage.
3. Configure the paper trading parameters.
4. Click "Deploy".
5. Monitor the paper trading performance.

### 6. Deploy to Live Trading

1. Click "Live Trading" to deploy the algorithm to live trading.
2. Select your brokerage (Interactive Brokers or Alpaca).
3. Configure the live trading parameters.
4. Click "Deploy".
5. Monitor the live trading performance.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

1. Use the QuantConnect dashboard to monitor the algorithm's performance.
2. Set up alerts for key performance metrics.
3. Monitor the algorithm's logs for any errors or warnings.

### Model Updates

1. Train new models using the Google Colab notebooks.
2. Push the updated models to GitHub.
3. QuantConnect will automatically pull the latest models.

### Algorithm Updates

1. Make changes to the algorithm code in GitHub.
2. Push the changes to GitHub.
3. QuantConnect will automatically pull the latest code.
4. Redeploy the algorithm to apply the changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure the model files are correctly pushed to GitHub and the URLs in the algorithm are correct.
2. **Brokerage Connection Issues**: Check your brokerage API keys and connection settings.
3. **Algorithm Errors**: Review the algorithm logs for any errors or warnings.

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Actions Integration

Use GitHub Actions to automate the model training and deployment process:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/retrain.yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"  # Weekly
jobs:
  train:
    runs-on: colab
    steps:
      - run: python ml_training.py
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ml_models/
```

### TradingView Integration

Use the TradingView integration to visualize the algorithm's signals:

1. Import the `qc_signal_mirror.pine` script into TradingView.
2. Configure the script to receive signals from QuantConnect.
3. Monitor the signals in real-time.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully deploy the QMP Overrider system on QuantConnect for live trading. The system's advanced market intelligence components, including the Market Maker Slayer, will provide you with a significant edge in the markets.
