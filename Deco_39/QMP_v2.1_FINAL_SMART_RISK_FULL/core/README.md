# Market Mind Reader

The Market Mind Reader is an advanced market analysis toolkit that enhances the QMP Overrider system with three powerful modules:

1. **Fed Whisperer Module**: Predicts Fed impact using free SEC filings and Fed speech analysis
2. **Candlestick DNA Sequencer**: Uses fractal geometry to predict candle patterns
3. **Liquidity X-Ray**: Reconstructs order flow from free Trade & Quote (TAQ) data

## Features

### Fed Whisperer Module

- Analyzes SEC EDGAR filings and Fed FRASER archives
- Identifies dovish and hawkish terms in Fed communications
- Predicts market impact of Fed sentiment
- Uses only free, publicly available data sources

### Candlestick DNA Sequencer

- Identifies candlestick patterns using TA-Lib
- Analyzes pattern cycles using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Predicts future patterns based on Fibonacci cycles (89 candles)
- Weights recent patterns 3x for more accurate predictions

### Liquidity X-Ray

- Detects hidden liquidity using free NYSE OpenBook Basic data
- Identifies dark pool activity through midpoint trade analysis
- Differentiates between retail and institutional behavior
- Predicts price impact based on order flow imbalances

### Enhanced Indicator

- Combines all three modules into a unified signal generator
- Implements SEC Rule 15c3-5 compliance (no trading within 5 minutes of news events)
- Tracks performance metrics for each enhancement
- Provides confidence scores for all signals

## TradingView Integration

The Market Mind Reader includes a TradingView Pine Script for visualizing signals:

```pinescript
//@version=5
strategy("Market Mind Reader", overlay=true)
fed_bias = input.source(security("ECONOMIC_FED", "DOVISH_SCORE"))
dna_pattern = input.source(security("SCRIPT:DNA", "PATTERN"))
if fed_bias > 0.7 and dna_pattern == "BULLISH"
    strategy.entry("GodMode", strategy.long)
```

## Usage

```python
from market_mind_reader import EnhancedIndicator

# Initialize the enhanced indicator
indicator = EnhancedIndicator()

# Get signal for a symbol
signal = indicator.get_signal("SPY")

print(f"Signal: {signal['signal']}")
print(f"Confidence: {signal['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Fed Bias: {signal['fed_bias']}")
print(f"DNA Pattern: {signal['dna_pattern']}")
print(f"Liquidity Direction: {signal['liquidity_direction']}")
```

## Critical Checks

1. **Never use inside 5 minutes of news events** (SEC Rule 15c3-5)
2. **Throttle API calls** to stay under free tier limits
3. **Paper trade test** for 1,000 signals before going live

## Data Sources

- **Fed Speech Analysis**: SEC EDGAR + Fed FRASER archives
- **TAQ Data**: NYSE OpenBook Basic (free delayed feed)
- **Retail Sentiment**: Reddit API (r/wallstreetbets posts)

## Integration with QMP Overrider

The Market Mind Reader is designed to integrate seamlessly with the QMP Overrider system, enhancing its existing capabilities with advanced market intelligence.

## Legal Compliance

All data sources used by the Market Mind Reader are free, publicly available, and legal to use for trading purposes. The system includes safeguards to ensure compliance with SEC regulations, including Rule 15c3-5.
