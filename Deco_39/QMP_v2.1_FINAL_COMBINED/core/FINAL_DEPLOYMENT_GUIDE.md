# QMP Overrider Beyond God Mode - Deployment Guide

## Overview

The QMP Overrider Beyond God Mode is a multi-asset AI-powered trading strategy built for QuantConnect (Lean Engine). It combines spiritual/quantum gate logic, AI learning, timeframe alignment, and dynamic SL/TP estimation to generate high-quality trading signals for BTCUSD, ETHUSD, XAUUSD, DIA (US30), and QQQ (NASDAQ).

This guide provides instructions for deploying the system in both backtest and live trading environments.

## System Requirements

- QuantConnect account with API access
- Python 3.8+ for local development
- Streamlit for dashboard visualization
- 16GB+ RAM recommended for optimal performance
- Internet connection for real-time data feeds

## Deployment Steps

   - Ensure the signal log path is correctly set

3. **Launch Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

4. **Access Dashboard**:
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:8501
   - The dashboard will automatically refresh with new data
