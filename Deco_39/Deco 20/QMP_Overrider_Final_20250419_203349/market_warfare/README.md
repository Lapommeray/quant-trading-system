## Legal Safeguards

This package implements several legal safeguards to ensure compliance with SEC regulations:

1. **No Order Book Manipulation**: All orders must rest >500ms
2. **No Fake News**: Only analyzes existing social media trends
3. **No Latency Arbitrage**: Minimum 100ms execution delay
4. **SEC Rule Compliance**: No trading within 5 minutes of news events
5. **API Throttling**: All modules implement API throttling

## Usage

```python
from market_warfare import MarketCommander

# Initialize Market Commander
commander = MarketCommander()

# Execute tactics for a symbol
execution = commander.execute("SPY")

print(f"Tactic: {execution['tactic']}")
print(f"Signal: {execution['signal']}")
print(f"Confidence: {execution['confidence']:.2f}")

# Check legal compliance
compliance = commander.get_legal_compliance_checklist()
for check, status in compliance.items():
    if check != "timestamp":
        print(f"{check}: {'✓' if status else '✗'}")
```
